                        Champion. In 1999,
                        Prost received the World Sports Award of the Century in the motor sport category.During the 1980s
                        and early 1990s Prost formed a fierce sporting rivalry, mainly with Ayrton Senna
                        but also Nelson Piquet and Nigel Mansell. Senna joined Prost at McLaren in 1988 and the two had a
                        series of controversial clashes,
                        including a collision at the 1989 Japanese Grand Prix that gave Prost his third Drivers'
                        Championship.

                        He won five world championships in the 1950s, not an era renowned for safety. He did it for four
                        different teams – Alfa Romeo, Ferrari, Mercedes-Benz and Maserati – driving some of
                        the most genuinely iconic racing cars in the history of the sport, and finished second twice. And
                        while those were different times and far fewer races were run, Fangio’s hit rate is
                        still extraordinary: 29 pole positions, 48 front row starts, 24 victories, from 51 championship
                        Grands Prix starts.
                        He was 46 when he won his last title, in 1957, a testament to his immense physical strength.

                        He still polarises opinion, and there’s no question that he over-stepped the mark more often than
                        was necessary. To put it mildly. But Michael Schumacher remains an
                        all-time great and not just because he won seven world championships, 91 races and smashed every
                        record there was to smash. Or that he possessed the Senna-like ability to
                        drive his car right on the limit, while being physically fit and intelligent enough to keep a good
